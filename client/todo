NETWORK:
	* refactor - extract all game logic into a client-agnostic module (that can also run in a back-end environment, without graphics)
	* clients send keyboard inputs to server
	* server decides on all actions based on AI, timers and clients' input
	* server broadcasts updates to all clients which include:
		* entity positions and orientations (every 50ms)
		* events: (whenever they happen)
			* player pressed/released key
			* player spawned
			* bomb spawned
			* bomb exploded
			* fire spawned
			* fire expired
			* enemy changed direction
			* brick destroyed
			* powerup spawned
			* powerup consumed
			* player speed changed (as a result of consuming a powerup)
			* enemy fried
			* player fried
	* all "animation" entities are not handled by the server, but created only by the clients (characterExplodeAnimation for example).
